# 🧠 Understanding Semantic HTML - Stop Using Only `<div>`s!

## ❌ The Problem: Too Many `<div>`s

Many developers — especially beginners or those working with React — **overuse `<div>` tags** to build the entire structure of a webpage. This is often called **"div soup"** — a messy, unstructured page full of nested `<div>`s with no meaning.

> 🔍 **Did you know?**  
> Most junior developers don't use semantic tags properly and rely entirely on `<div>`s for everything — from headers to footers to articles.

But HTML gives us a much better way to structure content: **Semantic HTML**.

## ✅ What is Semantic HTML?

**Semantic HTML** refers to using HTML tags **that convey the meaning of the content** inside them. These tags not only describe how the content looks but also **what it means**.

### 🏷️ Common Semantic Tags:

| Tag        | Use Case                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `<header>` | Page or section heading               |
| `<nav>`    | Navigation links/menu                 |
| `<main>`   | Main content of the page              |
| `<section>`| Group of related content              |
| `<article>`| Independent, reusable content block   |
| `<aside>`  | Sidebars, tips, related content       |
| `<footer>` | Page or section footer                |
| `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` | Images with captions |
| `<time>`   | Dates and times                       |
| `<mark>`   | Highlighted or marked text            |
